## Reporting an issue to do with Minecraft Java Edition? Please report your issue in Mojang Bug Tracker

Welcome! We love Minecraft and would love to help, but this probably isn't quite the right place :-).

Please submit Minecraft related issues over at [https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues/](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues/). The Mojang folks will take the first pass at triaging the issue. If it is a genuine Microsoft Build of OpenJDK (Java/JVM) issue, then they'll open an issue with us.

For context, most Java crash reports with Minecraft are the result of Java calling a buggy native library, O/S driver or similar. So although you'll see a _Java_ crash report, the root cause is typically elsewhere.
